# Simulating One-lane Traffic Flow based on GA and Exploring the Factors Affecting Efficiency

This repository provides the source code and raw data (in an easy-to-view format) for Chapter 3 - "Evolution-based Simulation".

## 1.Source code
We provide two experiments **main_phase_1_ver.py** and **main_phase_2_ver.py**, which corresponds from TFM:
>3.3 Phase 1 - Find the "Most Civilised" Driver" 
>
>3.4 Phase 2 - Verify The Efficiency of Traffic Flow 

We have added new scenes **main_phase_1.2_ver.py** and **main_phase_2.1_ver.py** to give more humanity to the drivers in our model (the drivers are possibly distracted).

## 2.Raw data and Graphics
All graphics and their corresponding raw data are available in the **plot** and **raw data** folders.
